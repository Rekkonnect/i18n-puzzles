This repository contains solutions for [i18n-puzzles](https://i18n-puzzles.com/).

The structure of the project follows the general idea as followed in my [Advent Of Code solutions](https://github.com/Rekkonnect/AdventOfCode).

The inputs are also contained within the repo, following the disclaimer placed in [the inputs README](InternationalizationPuzzles/Inputs/README.md).
